# Sample Datasets for Data Processing

This document introduces example datasets for use in exercises, demos, and code snippets throughout the course.


## Sensor Data (for all exercises)
- **Description:** Synthetic time series sensor measurements (multi-channel, high-frequency)
- **Files:** `data/sensor_data.csv`, `data/sensor_data.xlsx`, `data/sensor_data.h5`
- **Columns:**
  - `timestamp`: Time in seconds
  - `sensor_1`, `sensor_2`, `sensor_3`, ...: Example sensor channels

## Usage
- Use these datasets for hands-on exercises, code demos, and testing data processing workflows.
- All code snippets in the main documentation reference these files for immediate success.
