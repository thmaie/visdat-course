# Course Organization

## Course Overview

**Course Title:** Visualization & Data Processing (VIS3VO)  
**Program:** FH OÖ Wels · Master Mechanical Engineering  
**Semester:** 3rd Semester  
**Lecturer:** Stefan Oberpeilsteiner

## Course Goals

This course aims to provide students with comprehensive skills in modern data processing and visualization:

### Primary Objectives

- Build **robust data pipelines** that can handle real-world engineering data
- Create **clear, meaningful visualizations** that communicate insights effectively
- Work with **3D content** using libraries like VTK, PyVista, and formats like glTF
- Design **interactive user interfaces** using Qt/PyQt, Dash, and other frameworks
- Practice **version control** and ensure reproducibility in all projects

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement end-to-end data processing workflows
- Choose appropriate visualization techniques for different types of engineering data
- Work collaboratively using Git and GitHub workflows
- Build interactive applications for data exploration
- Handle various data formats commonly used in engineering (HDF5, CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Apply both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms effectively

## Course Structure

### Weekly Topics Overview

1. **Week 1-3:** Introduction & Tools (Git, Markdown, Python/C++ basics)
2. **Week 4:** Data formats, Pandas/Polars, HDF5
3. **Week 5:** 2D Visualization (Matplotlib/Plotly)
4. **Upcoming weeks:** 3D content, interactive UIs, advanced topics

### Learning Approach

The course follows a **hands-on, project-based approach**:

- **Theory + Practice:** Each concept is immediately applied in practical exercises
- **Collaborative Learning:** Work in teams using industry-standard Git workflows
- **Real-world Problems:** Projects based on actual engineering scenarios
- **Iterative Improvement:** Continuous feedback through pull request reviews

## Workflow & Collaboration

### Repository-Based Learning

1. **Course Content:** All scripts and assignments are managed in GitHub repositories
2. **Student Work:** Fork the main repository and work in feature branches
3. **Submission:** Create Pull Requests for assignment submissions
4. **Review Process:** Peer and instructor reviews before merging
5. **Documentation:** All course materials written in Markdown for easy collaboration

### Version Control Benefits

- **Reproducibility:** Every change is tracked and can be recreated
- **Collaboration:** Multiple students can work on the same project safely
- **Learning History:** Students can see their progress over time
- **Industry Preparation:** Mirror professional software development practices

## Assessment & Grading

*Detailed grading criteria and assignment weights will be provided in subsequent course materials.*
