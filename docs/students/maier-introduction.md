## Sample Data Interest

Describe a type of engineering data you work with or are interested in analyzing:
- What kind of data is it? 
    measurements, simulations, sensor data, 
- What challenges does it present?
    Getting clear signals withoput noise, using a check if data is realstic or just measurment trash
- What insights would you like to extract from it?
    Hard to say, I think working on it is extract enough.
