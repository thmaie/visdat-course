# Purpose of this file
This repository uses GitHub Copilot to help maintain clear and consistent course material.  
These instructions define the writing style and formatting conventions that Copilot should follow when assisting with edits or generating new content.

# Writing style
- Use clear, coherent, and structured explanations suitable for engineering students.
- Prefer full sentences and short paragraphs.
- Avoid overly short bullet lists without explanation.
- Use normal hyphens (-) instead of long em dashes.

# Markdown rules
- Produce clean and valid Markdown that renders correctly in Docusaurus.
- Use headings to organize content.
- Include bullet lists only when they improve clarity.
- Use Docusaurus admonitions when appropriate:
  - :::note for definitions or terminology
  - :::info for background context
  - :::tip for best practices
  - :::warning for common pitfalls

# Course context
- Write in an approachable academic tone.
- Support conceptual understanding for topics such as data handling, visualization, and scientific computing.
- Keep examples minimal, correct, and relevant.
- Avoid inventing APIs or technical details.

# General behavior
- Improve readability and consistency when rewriting text.
- Preserve the intent of existing material unless small changes improve clarity.
